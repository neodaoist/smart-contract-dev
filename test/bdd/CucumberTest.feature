Feature: Testing out Cucumber for smart contracts =)

    Scenario: Writing BDD tests for Solidity
        Given a dev is learning how to write smart contracts
        And they have previous experience with BDD
        When they want to improve their e2e / acceptance test practices
        Then they should consider using Cucumber for expressing behavior
